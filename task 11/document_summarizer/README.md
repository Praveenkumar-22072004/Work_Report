# Document Summarizer (Technical vs Story)

This is a simple Streamlit app that lets you upload a document (TXT or PDF), choose a target summary style (Technical or Story), and produces:
- a summary generated by OpenAI
- a percentage breakdown (technical vs story) rendered as a pie chart

## Setup

1. Create a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # mac/linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # windows
```

2. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# Windows (PowerShell)
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-..."
```

4. Run the app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Notes & Next steps

- The app relies on the model to return JSON containing `summary`, `technical_pct`, and `story_pct`. If the model response cannot be parsed, the raw response will be shown.
- You can replace the model-based percentage calculation with a local approach (see `utils.py`) or use embeddings + a classifier for more reliable breakdowns.
- This repo intentionally keeps things simple so you can expand it (e.g., add FastAPI backend, user authentication, PDF OCR).
